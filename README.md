What Every Hipster Should Know About Functional Reactive Programming
====================================================================

It is a slide deck. Much code.

Navigate through slides using `PgUp` and `PgDn`.

Editor cheat sheet:

* `Ctrl-S` evaluates the whole buffer.
* `Ctrl-D` evaluates the top level expression at cursor point.
* `Ctrl-R` reloads the HTML document without evaluating the buffer.
* `Ctrl-,` toggles commenting of the current line or selection.
* `Ctrl-'` selects the token at point.
* `Ctrl-\` invokes autocomplete on the token at point.
* `Ctrl-I` shows the inferred type of the token at point.
* `Ctrl-Q` renames the variable at point.
* `Alt-.` jumps to the definition of the token at point.
* `Alt-,` jumps back.
* `Ctrl-K` and `Ctrl-Y` kills to end of line and yanks from the kill buffer as in Most Holy Emacs.
* `Ctrl-A` and `Ctrl-E` similarly moves cursor to start and end of line.
* `Tab` will indent the current line to where it's supposed to be.
* `Alt-Space` sends a space bar keypress event to the HTML document.
* etc. for enter and cursor keys.
* Finally, `Esc` moves focus from the editor back to the slide deck, so you can change slides etc. (Also, if the slide deck is active, `Tab` should focus the editor.)
